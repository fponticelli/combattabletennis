# Combat Table Tennis

Rules for Table Tennis with a twist.

----

## 1. Phases of a Point

### 1.1 The Normal Table Tennis Phase

Each point begins with normal table tennis rules. When playing with four players, a valid serve is one that travels diagonally across the court. If a player fails to return the ball, their opponent tentatively scores a point, pending the results of the Combat and Rest phases (1.2 and 1.3).

#### 1.1.1 Net During a Serve

Unlike standard table tennis rules, the ball may touch the net on a serve. Play may continue normally after this happens.

#### 1.1.2 "Still In Game"

During normal play, if the ball strikes the back wall and returns to the table, hitting the side controlled by the team that last hit the ball, the team that was supposed to receive the ball may call "still in game," in which case the wall acts like a teammate and the ball is still in play.

#### 1.1.3 Sportsmanship

This is not a thing. When a player has the ball and it is their turn to serve, they should feel no obligation to wait for their opponent to be ready. There are no "time-outs" for rules clarifications. 

### 1.2 The Combat Phase

#### 1.2.1 Entering Combat

As soon as the ball has left the hand of the serving player, combat may begin.

The combat phase starts at any point when either the ball has made contact with a person (excluding hands) or the ball is in a position where the point would normally be dead (e.g. multiple bounces on the table, hitting the ceiling, passing beyond the table without touching it). Combat ends when the ball touches the ground, with the exception of "Reset" (1.3).

#### 1.2.2 Scoring During Combat

During combat, a team scores a point when the ball makes contact with an opposing player. If the team scoring a combat point also scored a regular point, the points accumulate. For example, Team A makes a valid serve, and after bouncing on the opponents' side of the table, the ball makes contact with one of the players on Team B. In this case, Team A scores a point for the unreturned serve, as well as a combat point for striking an opposing player.

It is not possibile, however, for both teams to score during a single point. In the scenario above, if Team B had hit the ball back and made contact with a member of Team A before the ball touched the ground, both of Team A's points would have been canceled, and Team B would have won a single point.

Once combat has started, normal points (unreturned shots that hit the opponents' side of the table, following normal table tennis rules) can no longer be scored, with the exception of "Reset" (1.3).

#### 1.2.3 Hands During Combat

Once the point has entered combat, contact between the ball and a player's hands is equivalent to cantact with a wall. No points are scored for contact with hands, and the ball is still live until it touches the ground.

If a player catches the ball, they may not move their feet until the ball has been released. The ball may be thrown at an opponent. The player who caught the ball may not throw it and immediately strike it with their own paddle.

#### 1.2.4 Offsides

During combat, a player's feet must stay on their side of the plane created by the net. Players may lean over the net to block a shot, or slide their paddle under the net, but feet cannot cross. There is no known penalty for breaking this rule.

### 1.3 Reset!

At any point, if the ball touches the ground, one player may strike the ball a single time with their paddle and return it to the opponents' side of the table. This resets the point to the normal phase (which can lead to an additional combat phase, and so on).

As with the combat phase, points are cumulative, but can only be scored by one team. If Team A has earned 2 points, and they "reset" the game in this manner, their two points persist, and they earn the opportunity to add to their total. However, if Team B scores the final point after the reset, Team A's points are lost, and Team B wins the point.
